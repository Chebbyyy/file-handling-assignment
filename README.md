📂 File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment  

 📖 Description  
This project is a Python assignment that demonstrates **file handling** and **exception handling**. It allows a user to enter a filename, reads the file if it exists, processes its content, and writes the result to a new file. The program gracefully handles errors such as missing files or permission issues.  

🚀 Features  
- **File Read & Write Challenge** ✏️  
  Reads content from an input file and writes a modified version into a new file.  
  *(In this case, the text is converted to uppercase.)*  

- **Error Handling Lab** 🛠️  
  Prompts the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or cannot be read.
